### Summary

For me, web or software development, or even the whole IT sector is much more than just my career. Since IT is at the cornerstone of almost every other sector, I am fascinated by it and as such, it has also become my primary hobby. Besides web development, I am also very interested in cybersecurity. I consider myself a dedicated self-learner, I spend a lot of my time learning, researching and practically applying new topics or technologies, whether it is programming related or a new vulnerability like Log4Shell that is setting the internet on fire. If I'm not burning my retinas at the monitor, I'm likely trekking somewhere in the woods for my Junior Officer Command Training course, learning to become a better problem solver and team player for whatever situation life puts me in.

### Experience
So far I've had two full-stack developer internships.

* On the first I spent time translating a Photoshop design to HTML + CSS, hooking it up to Symfony Framework and customizing the back-end to fit the client's needs.

* On the second one I cooperated with another developer and developed a learning and grading system  from scratch. I used Django with SQLite for the back-end and React for the front-end.
